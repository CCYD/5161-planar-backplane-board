# IBM 5161 Planar / Backplane

This project is a clone of the IBM 5161 planar (backplane) board. The 5161 planar is a 2 layer board that is very similar to a 5150/5160 motherboard minus everything but some power rails, clock and the ISA bus.

This clone board is an accurate reproduction, accurate to within a few millimeters.

Design notes:

-The clone board is marked 1130600(TRS) on the front. TRS stands for TRS-Eric. This is how you can verify it is a clone board of this design.

-The back contains a datecode (currently 2350, 23rd year, 50th week). This datecode functions as the version of this board. If you create your own board with modifications or another manufacturer other than JLCPCB, you may want to consider changing this date code.

-The holes for the capacitor are larger than normal to allow for other styles / models of variable capacitor. More information can be found at [minuszerodegrees.net](https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5160/motherboard/IBM%205160%20motherboard%20-%20Capacitor%20C1%20replacement.htm).

Further information on the IBM 5161 is available from [minuszerodegrees.net](http://minuszerodegrees.net/5161/doco/5161_documentation.htm).

Clones of the IBM 5161 Sender and Receiver cards are available from Tube Time via [github.com]
